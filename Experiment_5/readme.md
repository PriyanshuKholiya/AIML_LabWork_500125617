# Experiment 5: Data Cleaning using Pandas

This repository contains the code for Experiment 5 in the AIML lab, focusing on data cleaning techniques using the Pandas library in Python. The experiment involves loading a dataset, identifying and handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

## Purpose

The main objective of this experiment is to demonstrate essential data cleaning practices, which are critical for ensuring the quality of data before analysis or modeling. Proper data cleaning helps to improve the accuracy and reliability of insights derived from data.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this experiment is named `sample_dataset.csv`, which contains information about individuals, including their names, ages, heights, weights, and scores.

### Sample Data Structure

| Name  | Age  | Height(cm) | Weight(kg) | Score |
|-------|------|------------|-------------|-------|
| John  | 23   | 175        | 70          | 85    |
| Alice | 25   | 168        | 62          | 90    |
| Bob   | 22   | NaN        | 78          | 88    |
| Emma  | 24   | 165        | 55          | 92    |
| Tom   | 23   | 170        | 72          | 87    |
